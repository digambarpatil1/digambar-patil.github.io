//create notes on short notes of above code
//Move semantics in C++ allows the resources of temporary objects to be moved rather than copied,
//which can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for objects that manage dynamic memory or other resources.
//In the above code, we define a class buffer that manages a dynamic array of characters.
//The class includes a constructor, destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor,
//and move assignment operator to handle resource management correctly.
//The move constructor and move assignment operator transfer ownership of the resource from the source object to the
//destination object, leaving the source object in a valid but unspecified state.
//This is done by transferring the pointer to the data and setting the source object's pointer to nullptr
//and size to 0, ensuring that the destructor of the source object does not attempt to free the resource.
//In the main function, we demonstrate the use of move semantics by creating a buffer object and then moving it to another buffer object using std::move.
//This avoids the overhead of copying the data, leading to more efficient code.     
//Note: The noexcept specifier is used in the move constructor and move assignment operator to indicate that these functions do not throw exceptions.
//This is important for performance optimization, as it allows certain standard library operations to use move semantics more effectively.
